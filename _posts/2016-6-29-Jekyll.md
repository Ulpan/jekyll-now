### What is a Blog?

A blog is a frequently updated online personal journal or diary. It is a place to express yourself to the world. A place to share your thoughts and your passions. Really, it’s anything you want it to be. For our purposes we’ll say that a blog is your own website that you are going to update on an ongoing basis. Blog is a short form for the word weblog and the two words are used interchangeably.
Once the haven of technical know-it-alls, blogging has suddenly caught-on as a legitimate hobby and has entered the mainstream. Every day millions of people, some of whom have no technical ability whatsoever, write on their blogs.
Starting Blog:
Pick your blog platform, domain name, and hosting provider
Create the look of your blog by using a beautiful theme
Tweak your blog to make sure it “fits” your desired look
Install the most effective plugins
Develop quality content for your blog

### What is a Jekyll?
"In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages supports Jekyll, a popular static site generator.
GitHub Pages is deeply integrated with Jekyll, a popular static site generator designed for blogging and software documentation, but used for much more. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers some other advanced templating features.
he main advantages of Jekyll are:

You can use Markdown instead of HTML. Markdown is simpler to read and write.
You can use common templates, such as headers and footers, that are shared across files.
You can use a simplified build process to build your site with GitHub Pages.

This is Jekyll's build process for managing your site:
1)Push file changes to your pages publishing branch
2)GitHub Pages publishes your site." (help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/)
