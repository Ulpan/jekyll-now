title: My first animation
---
We made animation at "Processing". How I sade before at this programm beside drawing we can make animation. At begining for me it was unclear and hard, I make a lot of mistakes. But teacher and other students help me, and explain what wronge I was doing. After that I it's seemed not so hard. For begining we made ball wich moves by mouse and moves himself. If I wasn't lazy, I have explainad you how it is workes. But realyti is cruel.
