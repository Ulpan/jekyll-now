For begining, what is a game? A game is structured form of play, usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool. Exist meny kindes of game, but all games need be convient for user. And it's task for designer, they needs make game comfortable for everyone. It's very hard and long work, because designer involve work from programming to cover for game. It's very importent work and I like it. Exactly designer unite engineer, artist and scientist in him self.
